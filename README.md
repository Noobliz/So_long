**A 2D graphical project aimed at creating a simple game using a minimal graphics library, focusing on event handling, map parsing, and dynamic rendering.**

## Objectives
- Create a small 2D game where the player moves across a map, collecting items and reaching the exit.
- Parse and validate map files according to specific rules (walls, collectibles, player, exit).
- Manage real-time input events (keyboard controls) and rendering updates.
- Handle memory management, graphics, and error cases gracefully.

## Skills developed
- Parsing and validating structured data (map files).
- Using a minimal graphical library (MiniLibX) to render images and handle events.
- Working with a game loop to manage real-time player movement and screen updates.
- Strengthening code organization, resource management, and attention to detail in user experience.
